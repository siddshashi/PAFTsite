            <p>When children are left to study at home, parents often feel overwhelmed or uncapable to assist. As three students who
                have been in such situations growing up, we feel inclined to help out children recieve the help they need. Why free? 
                Because we firmly believe money should not stand as a barrier between eager children and learning. There's no catch;
                we just want to help.</p>

                    <h3>Sidd Shashi</h3>
                    <p>Sidd Shashi has been an avid learner of math and science all throughout his life. He also loves teaching math 
                        and helps teach a summer school math course for incoming freshmen students. He is in 10th grade at Palo Alto 
                        High School, and you can find him playing on Paly’s football and baseball teams. Outside of school, Sidd enjoys
                        playing sports with friends, listening to music, reading books, and eating Mexican food. He understands that
                        children may not be able to receive adequate help from their parents, as he once was that struggling student.
                        He hopes to help those in need so that they will be able to succeed in their classes.

                    <h3>Aditya Mathur</h3>
                    <p>Aditya Mathur has been in the PAUSD school district since 6th grade and knows the tips and tricks to be 
                        successful in either middle school or high school. Aditya has been enrolled in the highest lane for math

                        internships at different hospitals, works with various community groups, and is an avid filmmaker that has
